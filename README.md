### A Cloud Guru - AWS Lambda Course
These are the notes and lab files for the AWS Lambda course on A Cloud Guru.
https://acloud.guru/learn/aws-lambda

This course did a great job of walking through some great introductory AWS Lambda projects. It covers an S3 upload, a Kinesis Stream input and a DynamoDB put and provides a solid overview of Lambda. All the content is there, but unfortunately it's not presented very well and there are some minor video editing issues.
